    Good morning Sir
    We want to develop a cybersecurity website

Hector:
    Our idea is to develop a website to bring our apps and our services to the world

Carles:
    Ok, what kind of services and apps are you talking about?

Manuel:
    Our services and apps are password managers, antibugs, firewalls and things like that

Carles:
    So your website would need a cart with an integrated payment method?

Hector:
    Yes, that sounds great. 
    Apart from that we need the products to be shown clearly on the website

Carles:
    Ok so we are using OpentTk to animate the images and recreate a cybersecutrity method with pseudorandom numbers to make it get to the largest number of people posible

Manuel:
    Moving on, we want to be known as a serious company, that's why we need a profesional and serious layout while we keep cybersecurity esence
